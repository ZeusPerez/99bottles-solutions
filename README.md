# 99 bottles of beer: solutions

This repository hosts solutions in multiple programming languages to the “99 bottles of beer” kata.

Inspired by the awesome [99 bottles of OOP ](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/) book, and as part of the [“What is good code? Evaluating code quality”](https://github.com/dcarral/good-code) workshop, participants are asked to pair during 30 minutes trying to satisfy the [provided test suite](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot).

Do you fancy? Happy hacking! ;)

## Context

After 30 minutes pairing on the problem, volunteers show and explain their solutions to the group. We all together discuss tradeoffs, design choices, etc.

Among 100+ participants, it's been difficult to find two pairs coming up with the very same solution. This wide range of coding approaches (under slight time pressure, in several programming languages and with different development environments) provides us with a solid starting point to discuss topics like:

  - XP practices such as simple design, pair programming, refactoring, test-driven development...
  - Software development concepts such as duplication tolerance, refactor aggressivity, layers of indirection, usage of conditionals, KISS / DRY / SOLID, etc.

Thus: why shouldn't we share (at least part of) the workshop experience with everyone by collaboratively creating a collection of solutions? [Sparked by a question by Daniel Teske](https://github.com/dcarral/good-code/issues/1), this repository was born as an attempt in doing so.

### Adding solutions

Would you like to add your solution(s)? That's awesome, please go ahead and [open a new pull request](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-solutions/pull/new/master) ;)

Having problems or doubts trying to do it? Don't hesitate to ask for help, you can find a “Questions, suggestions, thoughts?” section below in this README.

### Improving test suites

During the early days of the workshop, participants in [Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/Software-Craftsmanship-Berlin/events/241973901/),  [Belgrade](https://www.meetup.com/Software-Craftsmanship-Serbia/events/244400269/) and [Mallorca](https://www.meetup.com/Mallorca-Software-Craftsmanship/events/244506252/) were asked to code on top of the [upstream repository from Sandi Metz](https://github.com/sandimetz/99bottles-polyglot).

Due to several pairs struggling with the provided project setups as well as the detection of inconsistencies among languages and the inconvenience of the Exercism-dependant constraints, [a fork was created](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot) trying to provide a smoother developer experience.

You can check out some of that work by taking a look at [recent pull requests](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/pulls). It's been awesome to receive pull requests from workshop participants!

Any contributions in this regard would be highly appreciated, specially taking into account the amount of supported languages.
