# 99 solutions

This repository hosts solutions (coded in 30 minutes) in multiple programming languages to the “99 bottles of beer” kata.

Up to the challenge? The initial test suite can be found @ [dcarral/99bottles-polyglot](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot).

We'll be happy to receive pull request(s) with your solutions! :-)

## Context

Inspired by the awesome book [99 bottles of OOP book](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/), participants of [“Good code: evaluating code quality” workshop](https://github.com/dcarral/good-code) invest 30 minutes trying to satisfy the provided test suite.

Afterwards, some of the pairs show their code and together we discuss tradeoffs, design choices, refactoring techniques and what not. 

Surprisingly enough, it's been difficult to find two pairs coming up with exactly the same solution. That variety of solutions and languages provide an awesome environment to talk software, generating interesting thought exchanges (e.g. duplication tolerance, order of tests, levels of indirection, KISS...).

So, we thought: why should we stop there and not collect a bunch of solutions online? That's how this repo was born, thanks a lot @dnltsk for sparking the light! ;) 

## Do you feel like improving the provided test suites / project setups?

We started using the original upstream repo from Sandi Metz, but due to a lot of pairs struggling with the provided project setup in some of the languages, decided to fork it and polish READMEs and test suites.

You can get a glimpse of some of that work by taking a look at [recent pull requests](https://github.com/dcarral/99bottles-polyglot/pulls). 

Since there's still a lot of room for improvement to achieve an even smoother setup process, any contributions will be more than welcome.

## Do you have any ideas / suggestions? Don't know where to start?

Please feel free to open an issue (in any of the related repositories), we will be happy to hear from you ;)

Happy hacking!
